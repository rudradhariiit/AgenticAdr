# ADR-003: Modular and Maintainable Styling with Sass

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The need for an organized, scalable, and maintainable approach to styling the course website, avoiding the complexities and redundancy often associated with vanilla CSS in larger projects.

## Decision
Implement styling using Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), organizing stylesheets into modular components within the `_sass/` directory.

## Consequences
Promotes modularity, reusability, and easier management of styles; improves maintainability and reduces styling conflicts across different components; allows for advanced CSS features such as variables, mixins, and nesting; enhances the overall aesthetic consistency and developer experience for styling.
