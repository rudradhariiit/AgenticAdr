# ADR-001: Adoption of Jekyll as a Static Site Generator

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The need for a high-performance, secure, easily deployable, and version-controlled website solution for an academic course, without the complexity and overhead of a dynamic content management system.

## Decision
To build the course website using Jekyll, leveraging Markdown for content creation and Liquid for templating, which generates static HTML files.

## Consequences
Ensures high performance and security due to serving static assets; simplifies deployment (especially to platforms like GitHub Pages); integrates seamlessly with Git for version control; provides a cost-effective hosting solution; relies on Ruby for the build process, requiring Ruby environment knowledge.
