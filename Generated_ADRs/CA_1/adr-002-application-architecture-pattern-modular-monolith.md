### ADR-002: Application Architecture Pattern (Modular Monolith)

**Status:** Inferred
**Context:** We are a new startup with a small team and an evolving product roadmap. The initial focus is on rapid development, frequent iteration, and proving market fit. While microservices offer benefits for large, mature organizations, they introduce significant operational and development complexity (distributed transactions, inter-service communication, distributed tracing). We need an architecture that allows for agility without immediate overhead but can evolve.
**Decision:** We will adopt a Modular Monolith architecture. The application will be deployed as a single unit but internally structured into well-defined, loosely coupled modules with clear boundaries and interfaces (e.g., using hexagonal architecture principles or clear package separation in code). Each module will encapsulate its own domain logic, data models, and potentially even database tables/schemas. This allows us to start simply and defer the complexity of distributed systems, while laying the groundwork for potential future extraction into independent microservices if and when justified by business needs and team growth.
**Consequences:**
*   **Positive:** Faster initial development and deployment, simpler operational overhead (single codebase, single deployment unit, no distributed systems complexity), easier debugging and testing, strong consistency guarantees within the application, easier refactoring across modules. Reduced inter-service communication latency.
*   **Negative:** Scalability might be limited if a single module becomes a bottleneck (requiring scaling the entire application vertically or horizontally, even if only one part needs it). Changes in one module *could* unintentionally impact others if modularity is not strictly enforced. Potential for "big ball of mud" if module boundaries and discipline are not maintained diligently. Future transition to microservices, while planned for, will still require significant effort.
